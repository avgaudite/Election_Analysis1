## Application For Other Elections
The code for both the votes by county and votes by candidate are in essence the same. Variables were renamed and references changed to fit the task of capturing data for either county or candidate.

Should an audit need to be performed for a presidential election, the code can be reworked with different names, districts, etc. If other data is captured, such as the gender breakdown of each county, the code can also be applied.
